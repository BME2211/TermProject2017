# TermProject2017
The objective of this term project is to provide students with the hands-on experience of image
classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is one of Deep Neural
Networks.
1) Use the pre-trained model to classify the natural images to get the sense of
deep learning based image classification. 
2) Training a preconfigured model to classify the
hand-written digits using MNIST dataset. 
3) Fine tune a CNN model to classify the mitotic vs.
non-mitotic cells in the histological image dataset
